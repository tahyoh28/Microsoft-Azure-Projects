# ☁️ Microsoft Azure Project – Cloud Computing with Virtual Machine

## 📝 Project Summary
This project demonstrates the use of **Microsoft Azure's cloud computing platform** to set up a virtual machine (VM) environment for practicing and executing SQL queries. The hands-on experience involved provisioning a VM, connecting to it remotely, and using it as a secure workspace for database exploration and querying.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand core concepts of cloud computing using Microsoft Azure
- Provision and configure a virtual machine (Windows/Linux)
- Connect securely to the VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or SSH
- Install and run a database management system (e.g., MySQL or SQL Server)
- Practice SQL queries in a cloud-hosted environment

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Services Used
- **Microsoft Azure Portal**
- **Azure Virtual Machine (VM)**  
- **Remote Desktop Connection / SSH Terminal**
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** or MySQL Workbench
- **Windows/Linux OS (depending on configuration)**

---

## 📌 Key Activities
- Created and configured a virtual machine on Microsoft Azure
- Ensured network security via firewall rules and NSG settings
- Installed SQL Server and connected to the database engine
- Wrote and tested basic to intermediate SQL queries directly in the VM
- Explored database schemas and used query output for data analysis

---

## 📈 Outcome
- Gained hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure and VM provisioning
- Demonstrated understanding of how cloud platforms support database workloads
- Strengthened SQL querying skills in a real-world, cloud-based setup
